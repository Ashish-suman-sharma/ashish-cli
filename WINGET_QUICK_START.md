# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start - Winget Publication

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `ashish-cli`
3. **Description**: `Universal multi-language code compiler and executor CLI tool`
4. **Public repository**: âœ… (required for Winget)
5. **Don't initialize** with README (we have everything ready)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

## Step 2: Run Automated Setup (1 minute)

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```powershell
.\complete-winget-submission.ps1 -GitHubUsername "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
```

This script will:
- âœ… Update all Winget manifests with your GitHub username
- âœ… Connect your local repository to GitHub
- âœ… Push all your code to GitHub
- âœ… Prepare everything for Winget submission

## Step 3: Create GitHub Release (2 minutes)

The script will tell you exactly where to go, but here's the quick version:

1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ashish-cli/releases`
2. **Click**: "Create a new release"
3. **Tag**: `v1.0.0`
4. **Title**: `Ashish CLI v1.0.0 - Initial Release`
5. **Upload**: `dist\ashish.exe` file
6. **Click**: "Publish release"

## Step 4: Submit to Winget (30 seconds)

After the release is created, run this command (the script will give you the exact command):

```powershell
wingetcreate new "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ashish-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/ashish.exe"
```

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your package will be submitted to Microsoft for review. Users will be able to install it with:

```cmd
winget install Ashish.AshishCLI
```

## Total Time Required: ~5 minutes
